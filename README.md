# YomiBashi – Japanese Subtitle Converter

YomiBashi is a React-based web application that allows users to upload Japanese `.srt` subtitle files and convert them into a more readable format (romaji/furigana-style) for language learning.
This frontend connects to the YomiBashi FastAPI backend and provides a simple, mobile-first interface for file upload and download.

## Why need a Intra-Language Subtitle Converter? 
Learning a new language through movies, anime, and TV shows is one of the most effective and enjoyable methods.
Many Japanese learners prefer watching content with subtitles to improve listening and reading skills at the same time.

However, beginners face a major problem when learning Japanese.

Japanese writing uses three scripts:
* Hiragana
* Katakana
* Kanji

Among these, **Kanji is the most complex** and difficult for beginners to read.
Most Japanese subtitle files available online use Kanji, which makes them hard to understand for new learners.

Because of this, beginners often prefer **Romaji**, which is the representation of Japanese sounds using the English alphabet.

Example:
```
Kanji: ありがとう
Romaji: arigatou
```
Unfortunately, Romaji subtitles are rarely available for most shows and movies.

This project solves that problem.

Users can upload a Japanese subtitle file (`.srt`) containing Kanji/Hiragana/Katakana,
and the system converts the text into **Romaji subtitles**, which beginners can easily read.
